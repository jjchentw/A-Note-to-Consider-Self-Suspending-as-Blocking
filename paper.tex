\section{Introduction}

This report presents a proof to support the correctness of the feasibility test for self-suspending real-time task systems by Jane W. S. Liu in the textbook. Since there was no proof in the book, this report provides the reasoning of the correctness.  

We define the
terminologies in this section for completeness.  A sporadic task
$\tau_i$ is released repeatedly, with each such invocation called a
job. The $j^{th}$ job of $\tau_i$, denoted $\tau_{i,j}$, is released
at time $r_{i,j}$ and has an absolute deadline at time $d_{i,j}$. Each
job of any task $\tau_i$ is assumed to have execution time $C_i$. Each job of task $\tau_i$ 
suspends for at most $S_i$ time units (across all of its suspension phases).
The response time
of a job is defined as its finishing time minus its release
time. Successive jobs of the same task are required to execute in
sequence. Associated with each task $\tau_i$ are a period $T_i$, which
specifies the minimum time between two consecutive job releases of
$\tau_i$, and a deadline $D_i$, which specifies the relative deadline
of each such job, i.e., $d_{i,j}=r_{i,j}+D_i$. The worst-case response
time of a task $\tau_i$ is the maximum response time among all its
jobs.  The utilization of a task $\tau_i$ is defined as $U_i=C_i/T_i$.
