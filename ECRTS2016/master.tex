\begin{abstract}
  For real-time embedded systems, self-suspending behaviour can cause
  substantial performance/schedulability degradation. In this paper,
  we focus on preemptive fixed-priority scheduling for the dynamic
  self-suspension task model on a uniprocessor platform. In this
  model, a job of a sporadic task can suspend itself dynamically under
  a specified upper bound on the self-suspension across all of its
  suspension phases. To quantify the higher-priority interferences,
  the results in the literature for this task model can be classified
  into three classes (i) suspension as computation, (ii)
  suspension-induced release jitter, and (iii) suspension as blocking.
  However, the suspension-induced release jitter has to be carefully
  specified, and the concept to model suspension as blocking was never
  proven to be correct in the past. This paper presents a unifying
  response time analysis framework for the dynamic self-suspending
  task model. We provide a rigorous proof and show that all the three
  classes mentioned above are analytically dominated by this unifying
  framework. Therefore, all of them are in fact correct, and are
  inferior to the proposed response time analysis in this paper.  The
  evaluation results show that the analysis framework can have a huge
  improvement (an increase of up to $50\%$ of the number of task sets
  deemed schedulable) over these state-of-the-art analyses.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we study preemptive fixed-priority scheduling for the
dynamic self-suspension task model on a uniprocessor platform. This
paper presents a unifying response time analysis framework in
Theorem~\ref{theorem:general-framework} and
Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework}. We show that this result
analytically dominates all the existing analyses presented in
Section~\ref{sec:existing-analyses}, and, hence, we also implicitly
prove the correctness of all these analyses. Although it may seem that
Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework} requires exponential time
complexity, we show that a simple heuristic algorithm provided in
Section~\ref{sec:linear-approximation} can work already very well.

In fact, the response time analysis and the schedulability tests in
Section~\ref{sec:existing-analyses} and
Theorem~\ref{theorem:general-framework} can be further approximated to
polynomial-time complexity. For example, by over-approximating the
jitter used in Section~\ref{sec:jitter}, Liu and Chen
in \cite{LiuChen:rtss2014} provided a utilization-based schedulability
test based on a hyperbolic-form. Moreover, as presented in
Section~\ref{sec:suspension-blocking}, Liu in \cite{Liu:2000:RS:518501}
in fact used the blocking time for a schedulability test based on the
RM utilization bound. Our test in
Theorem~\ref{theorem:linear-time-test} is a linear-time test. The
above tests can be further improved by using the k2U and the k2Q
frameworks
in \cite{ChenHLRTSS2015,DBLP:journals/corr/ChenHL15b}. However, as
polynomial-time schedulability tests are not the focus of this paper,
such options were not seriously discussed here.
