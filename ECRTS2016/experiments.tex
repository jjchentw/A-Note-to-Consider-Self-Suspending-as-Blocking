\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

In this section, we present experiments conducted on randomly generated task sets. Five schedulability tests for dynamic self-suspending tasks are compared, namely, the suspension oblivious approach (Section~\ref{sec:suspension-oblivious}), the modeling of suspension as a release jitter (Section~\ref{sec:jitter}), the analysis proposed by Jane W.S. Liu and proven correct in this paper, which models the suspension as blocking (Section~\ref{sec:suspension-blocking}), the generic framework of Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework} (called ECRTS 16 in the graph) and the test based on the linear approximation presented in Section~\ref{sec:linear-approximation}. Each point in the plots of Figure~\ref{fig:exp} represents the number of task sets that were deemed schedulable by the respective algorithm over $1000$ experiments.

The task sets were generated using the \texttt{randfixedsum} algorithm presented in \cite{Emberson-taskSetGeneration-2010}.
