%\subsection{A new Response time Analysis}

As already discussed in Section~\ref{sec:existing-analyses}, one can greedily convert the suspension time of task $\tau_k$ in computation time. Let $\tau_k'$ be this converted version of task $\tau_k$, i.e., $\tau_k' = (C_k + S_k, 0, D_k, T_k)$.  Suppose that $R_k'$ is the worst-case response time of $\tau_k'$ in the modified task set $\setof{\tau_1, \tau_2, \ldots, \tau_{k-1}, \tau_k'}$. It was already shown in previous works, e.g., Lemma~3 in
\cite{Liu_2014}, that $R_k'$ is a safe upper bound on the worst-case response time of task $\tau_k$ in the original task set.

Note that in all this section, we implicitly assume that $R_i
\leq D_i, \forall \tau_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq k-1$.  Our key result in
this paper is the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
   \label{theorem:general-framework}
   Suppose that $R_k \leq T_k$. Then, for any arbitrary vector assignment $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{k-1})$, in which $x_i$ is either $0$ or $1$, the worst-case
   response time $R_k$ of $\tau_k$ is upper bounded by the minimum $t$ larger than $0$ such that 
   {\small \begin{equation} \label{eq:TDA-suspension-tighter0} 
       C_k + S_k + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\ceiling{\frac{t+Q_i^{\vec{x}}+(1-x_i)(R_i-C_i)}{T_i}} C_i \leq t
     \end{equation}}where $Q_i^{\vec{x}} \equals \sum_{j=i}^{k-1} (S_j \times x_j)$.
 \end{theorem} 
\begin{theorem}
   \label{theorem:general-framework-not-feasible}
   Suppose that $R_k > T_k$. For any arbitrary vector assignment
   $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{k-1})$, in which $x_i$ is either
   $0$ or $1$,  we have $\forall t | 0 < t \leq T_k$,
   {\small \begin{equation*}
       C_k + S_k + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\ceiling{\frac{t+Q_i^{\vec{x}}+(1-x_i)(R_i-C_i)}{T_i}} C_i > t
     \end{equation*}}where $Q_i^{\vec{x}} \equals \sum_{j=i}^{k-1} (S_j \times x_j)$.
 \end{theorem} 
 %We will explain the resulting properties from
 %Theorem~\ref{theorem:general-framework} first, by leaving the proof
 %to Section~\ref{sec:proof-th1} since it is pretty long.   
 One can directly derive the
 following schedulability test from Theorem~\ref{theorem:general-framework}.

 \begin{Corollary}
   \label{corollary:general-framework}
   If there is a vector $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots,
   x_{k-1})$ with $x_i \in \{ 0, 1\}$, such that 
   {\small \begin{align} 
   \label{eq:TDA-suspension-tighter} 
       & \exists t | 0 < t \leq D_k,  \nonumber \\
       & C_k + S_k + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\ceiling{\frac{t+Q_i^{\vec{x}}+(1-x_i)(R_i-C_i)}{T_i}} C_i \leq t
     \end{align}}
     where $Q_i^{\vec{x}} \equals \sum_{j=i}^{k-1} (S_j \times x_j)$, then the constrained-deadline task $\tau_k$ is schedulable under fixed-priority.
 \end{Corollary}
 \begin{proof}
 \end{proof}
 
  The proof of correctness of Theorem~\ref{theorem:general-framework} and hence Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework} is provided in Section~\ref{sec:proof-th1}. Moreover, we will later prove in Section~\ref{sec:dominance}, that Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework} in fact dominates all the analyses discussed in Section~\ref{sec:existing-analyses}.
 
 We now use the same example as in Section~\ref{sec:rationale}, to demonstrate how
Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework} can be applied.
 
 \begin{example}
 \label{ex:general_framework}
  Consider the same three tasks used in Examples~\ref{ex:rationale_1} and~\ref{ex:rationale_2}, i.e., $\tau_1 = (4, 5, 10, 10)$, $\tau_2 =(6, 1, 19, 19)$ and $\tau_3 = (4, 0, 50, 50)$. There are four possible vector assignments $\vec{x}$ when considering the schedulability of task $\tau_3$ with Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework}:

\noindent\textbf{Case 1.} $\vec{x} = (0 , 0)$: In this case, Theorem~\ref{theorem:general-framework} states that $R_k$ is upper bounded by the minimum $t$ under $0 < t \leq D_3$ such that $4+ \ceiling{\frac{t+5}{10}} 4 + \ceiling{\frac{t+9}{19}} 6 \leq t$. Note that this equation is identical to the schedulability test discussed in Section~\ref{sec:jitter}, and hence, as shown in Example~\ref{ex:rationale_1}, we get that $R_k \leq 42$.

\noindent\textbf{Case 2.} $\vec{x} = (0 , 1)$:
 In this case, Theorem~\ref{theorem:general-framework} states that $R_k$ is upper bounded by  the minimum $t$
under $0 < t \leq D_3$ that satisfies $4+ \ceiling{\frac{t+6}{10}} 4 + \ceiling{\frac{t+1}{19}} 6 \leq t$. As a solution, we get that $R_k \leq 32$. % due to $4+ \ceiling{\frac{32+7}{10}} 4 + \ceiling{\frac{32+1}{19}} 6=32$.
       
\noindent\textbf{Case 3.} $\vec{x} = (1 , 0)$:
 In this case, we look for the minimum $t$ such that $4+ \ceiling{\frac{t+5}{10}}\cdot 4 + \ceiling{\frac{t+9}{19}}\cdot 6 \leq t$. Hence, we get $R_k \leq 42$.

\noindent\textbf{Case 4.} $\vec{x} = (1 , 1)$:
 In this case, Theorem~\ref{theorem:general-framework} states that $R_k$ is upper bounded by  the minimum $t$
under $0 < t \leq T_3$ such that $
       4+ \ceiling{\frac{t+6}{10}}\cdot 4 + \ceiling{\frac{t+1}{19}}\cdot 6 \leq t$ leading to $R_k \leq 32$.% due to $4+ \ceiling{\frac{32+6}{10}} 4 + \ceiling{\frac{32+1}{19}} 6=32$.

Among the above four cases, the tests in Cases 2 and 4 are the tightest. Therefore, by
Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework}, $\tau_3$ is
schedulable under fixed-priority.
\hfill\myendproof
 \end{example}

Note also that the upper bound on $\tau_3$'s WCRT computed in Example~\ref{ex:general_framework}, is lower than the WCRT estimate obtained in Example~\ref{ex:rationale_2}. The response time analysis presented in Corollary~\ref{corollary:general-framework} is therefore tighter than the simple combination of existing analysis techniques proposed in Example~\ref{ex:rationale_2}.
